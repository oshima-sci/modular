The second claim builds upon and validates the first claim through direct experimental manipulation.,acf52d27-7c31-4096-af22-9f53124e5954,339a5afb-fcce-4a86-8db0-61c5b7820889

These are complementary aspects of the same phenomenon that can both be true simultaneously.",acf52d27-7c31-4096-af22-9f53124e5954,9f159ba9-7ed1-4c2b-9d87-f770d8888d11

The finding that lithium combined with tamoxifen is well-tolerated (claim 2) builds upon lithium being an established effective treatment.,d4e77fc9-7d46-473c-86f9-13b018308d00,e94c05b3-ab35-4b9f-86a5-009428370c62
