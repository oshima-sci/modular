        "abstract": "After decades of research, the mechanism of action of lithium in preventing recurrences of bipolar disorder remains only partially understood. Lithium research is complicated by absence of suitable animal models of bipolar disorder and by having to rely on in vitro studies of peripheral tissues. A number of distinct hypotheses emerged over the years, but none has been conclusively supported or rejected. The common theme emerging from pharmacological and genetic studies is that lithium affects multiple steps in cellular signalling, usually enhancing basal and inhibiting stimulated activities. Some of the key nodes of these regulatory networks include GSK3, CREB, and Na + -K + ATPase. Genetic and pharmacogenetic studies are starting to generate promising findings, but remain limited by small sample sizes. As full responders to lithium seem to represent a unique clinical population, there is inherent value and need for studies of lithium responders. Such studies will be an opportunity to uncover specific effects of lithium in those individuals who clearly benefit from the treatment.",

        "abstract": "Background: Considerable amount of biochemical data supports the potential involvement of protein kinase C in the pathophysiology and treatment of bipolar disorder. The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of tamoxifen as an adjunct to lithium for the treatment of acute mania in hospitalized bipolar patients. Methods: Eligible participants were 40 inpatients, between the ages of 19 and 49 years with current manic episode. Patients were randomly allocated to lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L) + tamoxifen 80 mg/day (group A) or lithium (1-1.2 mEq/L) + placebo (group B) for a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The principal measure of outcome was the Young Mania Rating Scale. The raters used standardized instructions for Young Mania Rating Scale. Results: Young Mania Rating Scale scores improved with tamoxifen. The difference between the two protocols was significant as indicated by the effect of the group, the between-subjects factor (F = 5.41, df =1, p = 0.02). A significant difference was observed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at week 6 in the two groups. The difference between the two groups in the frequency of side effects was not significant except for fatigue that occurred more often in the tamoxifen group. Limitations: Tamoxifen is an antagonist of estrogen receptor as well. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the combination of tamoxifen with lithium was superior to lithium alone for the rapid reduction of manic symptoms. The combined use of tamoxifen with lithium was well tolerated in these acutely manic patients.",

        "abstract": "Background: The increase in glutamate efflux in the prefrontal cortex by the psychotomimetic drugs phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine may produce the dopaminergic and some of the behavioral effects of these drugs. Here, we examined whether antipsychotic drugs influence this increase. Methods: The effect of haloperidol, clozapine or the 5-HT 2A antagonist, M100907, on PCP-induced increase in cortical glutamate efflux was examined by microdialysis. Because previous studies had suggested that M100907 attenuates some behavioral effects of PCP, we also examined the effect of M100907 on PCP-induced cortical and accumbal dopamine activation while making concomitant measures of locomotion and stereotypy. Results: Haloperidol, clozapine or M100907 did not significantly block hyperglutamatergic effects of PCP. M100907 was ineffective in inhibiting the dopaminergic and motoric effects of PCP. Conclusions: These results contrast previous findings with glutamatergic drugs, such as AMPA antagonists or group II metabotropic glutamate agonists, that blocked glutamatergic and motoric effects of PCP. Thus, the PCP glutamate activation model lacks predictive validity for conventional antipsychotics; however, this model may be useful for design of novel classes of drugs that target those symptoms of schizophrenia that are not generally treated with monoamine-based antipsychotics.",

        "abstract": "Lithium is a highly effective medication for bipolar disorder, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. In this study, brain MRI scans and blood samples for gene expression (total of 110 scans and 109 blood samples) were collected from 21 bipolar subjects before and after 2 and 8 weeks of lithium monotherapy and at the same timepoints from untreated 16 healthy controls. We used linear mixed-effects models to identify brain structural features and genes with expression changed after lithium treatment, with correction for multiple testing, and correlated their concurrent changes to identify molecular pathways associated with lithium effects. There are significant increases in gray matter fraction, global cortical thickness, and the frontal and parietal cortices after 8 weeks of lithium treatment (corrected p < 0.05). Volume increases were also seen for putamen, hippocampus, thalamic nuclei, and thalamic substructures. Several genes showed significant expression changes, and 14 gene pathways were identified for the present integration analysis. Of these, nine pathways had significant correlations with structural changes (FDR < 0.05). Three neurotrophy-related pathways (GDNF family of ligands, NFAT immune-response, and p53-signaling pathway) correlated with structural changes in multiple regions. Mediation analysis showed that the sphingomyelin metabolism pathway is associated with HAM-D change (p < 0.01), and this effect is mediated via the volume of mediodorsal thalamus (p < 0.03). In summary, the integration of lithium effects on brain structural and peripheral gene expression changes revealed effects on several neurotrophic molecular pathways, which provides further insights into the mechanism of lithium action.",

        "abstract": "Lithium has been the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD) for more than six decades. Although the molecular effects of lithium have been studied extensively and gene expression changes are generally believed to be involved, the specific mechanisms of action that mediate mood regulation are still not known. In this study, a multi-step approach was used to explore the transcriptional changes that may underlie lithium's therapeutic efficacy. First, we identified genes that are associated both with lithium exposure and with BD, and second, we performed differential expression analysis of these genes in brain tissue samples from BD patients (n=42) and healthy controls (n=42). To identify genes that are regulated by lithium exposure, we used high-sensitivity RNA-sequencing of corpus callosum (CC) tissue samples from lithium-treated (n=8) and non-treated (n=9) rats. We found that lithium exposure significantly affected 1108 genes (FDR <0.05), 702 up-regulated and 406 down-regulated. These genes were mostly enriched for molecular functions related to signal transduction, including well-established lithium-related pathways such as mTOR and Wnt signaling. To identify genes with differential expression in BD, we performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis on BD-associated genetic variants from the most recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) using three different gene expression databases. We found 307 unique eQTL genes regulated by BD-associated variants, of which 12 were also significantly modulated by lithium treatment in rats. Two of these showed differential expression in the CC of BD cases: RPS23 was significantly down-regulated (p=0.0036, fc=0.80), while GRIN2A showed suggestive evidence of down-regulation in BD (p=0.056, fc=0.65). Crucially, GRIN2A was also significantly up-regulated by lithium in the rat brains (p=2.2e-5, fc=1.6), which suggests that modulation of GRIN2A expression may be a part of the therapeutic effect of the drug. These results indicate that the recent upsurge in research on this central component of the glutamatergic system, as a target of novel therapeutic agents for affective disorders, is warranted and should be intensified.",

        "abstract": "Neurotrophins are growth factors implicated in the development and maintenance of different neuronal populations in the nervous system. Neurotrophins bind to two sets of receptors, Trk receptor tyrosine kinases and the p75 NTR receptor, to activate several different signaling pathways that mediate various biological functions. While Trk receptor activation has been well-studied and triggers the well-characterized Ras/Rap-MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and PLC\u03b3-PKC cascades, p75 NTR signaling is more complex, and its in vivo significance has not yet been completely determined. In the last few years, p75 NTR has received much attention mainly due to recent findings describing pro-neurotrophins as new ligands for the receptor and the ability of the receptor to form different complexes with other transmembrane proteins. This review will update the neurotrophin signaling pathways known for Trk receptors to include newly identified Trk-interacting molecules and will address surprising new findings that suggest a role for p75 NTR in different receptor complexes and functions.",

        "abstract": "Human and animal studies suggest an intriguing link between mitochondrial diseases and depression. Although depression has historically been linked to alterations in monoaminergic pharmacology and adult hippocampal neurogenesis, new data increasingly implicate broader forms of dampened plasticity, including plasticity within the cell. Mitochondria are the cellular powerhouse of eukaryotic cells, and they also regulate brain function through oxidative stress and apoptosis. In this paper, we make the case that mitochondrial dysfunction could play an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and membrane polarity, which increase oxidative stress and apoptosis, may precede the development of depressive symptoms. However, the data in relation to antidepressant drug effects are contradictory: some studies reveal they have no effect on mitochondrial function or even potentiate dysfunction, whereas other studies show more beneficial effects. Overall, the data suggest an intriguing link between mitochondrial function and depression that warrants further investigation. Mitochondria could be targeted in the development of novel antidepressant drugs, and specific forms of mitochondrial dysfunction could be identified as biomarkers to personalize treatment and aid in early diagnosis by differentiating between disorders with overlapping symptoms.",

        "abstract": "The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology and therapeutics of bipolar disorder are still unknown. In recent years, protein kinase C (PKC) has emerged as a potential key player in mania. To further investigate the role of this signaling system in mood regulation, we examined the effects of PKC modulators in behavioral tests modeling several facets of bipolar disorder and in adult hippocampal cell proliferation in rats. Our results showed that a single injection of the PKC inhibitors tamoxifen (80 mg/kg, i.p.) and chelerythrine (3 mg/kg, s.c.) attenuated amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and decreased risk-taking behavior, supporting the efficacy of PKC blockade in acute mania. Moreover, chronic exposure to tamoxifen (10 mg/kg/day, i.p., for 14 days) or chelerythrine (0.3 mg/kg/day, s.c., for 14 days) caused depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test, and resulted in a reduction of cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Finally, we showed that, contrary to the PKC inhibitors, the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) enhanced risk-taking behavior and induced an antidepressant-like effect. Taken together, these findings support the involvement of PKC in regulating opposite facets of bipolar disorder, and emphasize a major role for PKC in this disease.",

It is essential for the development of the CNS and for neuronal plasticity.

In addition, the review includes a discussion of the role of BDNF in the mechanism of action of pharmacological therapies currently used to treat these diseases, such antidepressants and antipsychotics. The review also covers a critique of experimental therapies such as BDNF mimetics and discusses the value of BDNF as a target for future drug development.",

        "abstract": "In the second part we focus on two treatment strategies that may overcome the main limitations of current antidepressant drugs. First, we review the experimental and clinical evidence supporting the use of glutamatergic drugs as fast-acting antidepressants. Secondly, we review the involvement of microRNAs in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and the use of small RNAs (e.g.., small interfering RNAs or siRNAs) to knockdown serotonergic genes and induce antidepressant-like responses in experimental animals. The development of glutamatergic agents is a promising venue for antidepressant drug development, given the antidepressant properties of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Its unique properties appear to result from the activation of AMPA receptors by a metabolite [(2S,6S;2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK)] and mTOR signaling. These effects increase synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons and enhance serotonergic neurotransmission via descending inputs to the raphe nuclei. This view is supported by the cancellation of ketamine's antidepressant-like effects by inhibition of serotonin synthesis. We also review existing evidence supporting the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in MDD and the preclinical use of RNA interference (RNAi) strategies to target genes involved in antidepressant response. Many miRNAs have been associated to MDD, some of which -e.g., miR-135-target genes involved in antidepressant actions. Likewise, we review the use of SSRI-conjugated siRNA (small interfering RNA) to evoke faster and/or more effective antidepressant-like responses. Intranasal application of sertraline-conjugated siRNAs directed to 5-HT1A receptors and SERT evoked much faster changes of pre-and postsynaptic antidepressant markers than those produced by fluoxetine.",

Actually, upon closer examination, Claim 2's statement that PKC activation produces 'antidepressant-like effects' alongside 'manic-like effects' creates an internal tension, but the core relationship between the claims is that Claim 2 describes what happens with PKC activation (produces mania-like behavior) which would logically support why Claim 1's PKC inhibition would be therapeutic. This makes Claim 2 a premise that supports the rationale in Claim 1.",

Claim 2 states that M100907 (a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, a type of monoamine-based drug) is ineffective against PCP's effects. These claims appear to support each other rather than contradict. However, upon closer examination, if M100907 is ineffective (Claim 2), this would actually support the model's validity for testing monoamine drugs, contradicting Claim 1's assertion that the model lacks predictive validity. Actually, re-evaluating: Claim 2's finding that M100907 is ineffective against PCP effects would be consistent with the model lacking predictive validity for monoamine drugs. These are better characterized as variant claims - both discussing the PCP model and monoamine drugs but from different specific angles (general validity vs. one specific drug's effects).",

These are related but distinct mechanistic explanations - notably, GSK3 inhibition can affect autophagy, but the claims emphasize different aspects of lithium's action without directly contradicting each other. They represent variant perspectives on lithium's neuroprotective mechanisms rather than duplicates or contradictions.",

          "reasoning": "Claim 1 establishes that lithium inhibits IMPase (inositol monophosphatase), which affects intracellular signaling. Claim 2 describes lithium's autophagy enhancement through IP3 signaling. Since IMPase inhibition by lithium leads to altered inositol phosphate metabolism (including IP3), Claim 1 provides the mechanistic foundation for understanding the IP3 signaling pathway described in Claim 2. The inhibition of IMPase (Claim 1) is a prerequisite mechanism that explains how lithium modulates IP3 signaling (Claim 2).",
