            <h3>What is Modular?</h3>
            <p>
                Modular is an experimental tool representing scientific knowledge as 
                graphs instead of papers. Modular extracts claims, methods and evidence
                from scientific papers and analyzes them for possible epistemic connections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Go from papers to interconnected graphs of knowledge. Identify pieces of evidence
                related to a claim, whether the evidence was published in the same or an entirely
                different paper. Find contradictions among claims, and guage the empirical support
                across the literature for a given claim.
